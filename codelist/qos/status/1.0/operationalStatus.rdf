        <skos:definition>
           The service or endpoint can be expected to function reliably and return
           correct and up-to-date information according to it's service and dataset descriptions.
           Any functinal changes in an operational service are properly documented and communicated 
           to the users, in advance if possible.
           An operational service is being monitored for malfunctions or other functional problems,
           and any noticed problems are reacted upon in a timely fashion.

        <skos:definition>
            The users of a pre-operational service or endpoint may experience occational 
            functional problems or downtime, and the functionality may occationally change without
            advance notification. There is an implicit intention to evolve a 
            pre-operational service into an operational service in time.

           Users of a non-operational service or endpoint should not expect that the describe 
           service is stabile or reliable. The functionality may change at the any time, and the 
           entire service may be unavailable or disappear completely at any time.
